## Country Info Directory

The link project published on Github can be found here [Country Info Directory](https://seenathgooding.github.io/reactive/).

## 1) API

This project uses this api for information about the countries: [API Used](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2-all/)

The flag image was retrieved from [FLag API](https://flagcdn.com/)
To retrieve the flag of a particular country you need to specify the standard alpha2code.

## Design

The page was designed to put red white and black around the top where it says Trinidad is the best country.
The rest of the directory was designed for visibility, with the bright green cards contrasting with the black background

## Functionality

I always wanted to memorise and be able to identify countries' flags and capitals. Hence I was motivated to create a directory where I can easily search for it(because I will probably never memorise it).
You can search countries by name to view their

1) Flag
2) Demonyn
3) Native Name
4) Population
5) Sub-Region
6) Capital

The image above demonstrates that if "pa" is entered as the search string it will filter the results accordingly.

- The best country in my heart will always be Sweet Sweet Trinidad <3. 

The user can click the button at the top and it will respond by displaying which country is the best.
